## cursorignore-helper

A small helper to manage a `.cursorignore` file, keep it tidy, and optionally align it with your `.gitignore`. Useful for speeding up AI/code tools by excluding large or irrelevant paths.

### Features
- Keep `.cursorignore` organized and readable
- Suggest common ignores for typical projects
- Sync ideas with `.gitignore` without affecting Git

### Getting Started
1. Install dependencies (if any) and open this project in your editor.
2. Create or update a `.cursorignore` file at the project root.
3. Run the helper (script/tooling) to update rules.

### Typical `.cursorignore` entries
```
node_modules/
dist/
build/
.next/
.venv/
*.log
coverage/
tmp/
.cache/
```
